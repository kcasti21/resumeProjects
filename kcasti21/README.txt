I was able to complete all parts of the assignment.  The instructions for the solve button were unclear about what information was to be updated to the button.  Because i was more interested in seeing what the computer was trying i have decided to update board with that information.  In order to accomplish this, i decided to do was to have two threads running along with my program.  The first of which updates the gui every 300ms(buttons and textBoxes), this is utilized to update the board always.  When the solve button is utilized this will also update the board by reading the current board state from the second thread running  the search alorithm.  Additionally when the user hits the solve button the best first search is run on the second thread.  The best first search contains a logic that causes a delay for 1ms to allow the user to see the baord updating.  This has caused a dramatic slowdown, i commented in the code where this happens so please remove it so you don't have to watch it while grading, additionally you will have to enable a small delay located within the constructor for the controller class (this will allow the content panel to update atleast once).
